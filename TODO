as in vb we started on was the type of message and what product its for as in say user 100 - 1200 is currently on accidents vb message now tone tool 1300 has just been put on Debt message.
Like a type of campaign, Idealy the mor info we see the better for managing so many users, its only litrally just happened with new type of vb message
we can just add them ion the sql view later on down the road
